B$S BRANDING ETHOS • DNA (v1)

CORE
- Raw elegance: minimal geometry, exact placement, generous breathing space.
- Monochrome first (#111 ink on light ground). Color only after form is perfect.
- Precision grid: 78–80 column text width; 8–12px equivalent margins in print; consistent line height.
- Birthmark rule: B$S appears small, inevitable, never loud.

TYPOGRAPHY
- Monospaced primary (ASCII purity). Avoid faux ligatures. No decorative fonts in body.
- Cursed/ritual variants allowed only as micro accent lines, never body text.

GRAPHICS
- Sigils: 1–2px strokes at 1000px (scale proportionally). No gradients. No drop shadows by default.
- Circles perfect; align to pixel grid. Center points when used must be optically balanced.

PALETTE
- Base: Ink #111, Paper #F7F7F5.
- Accent (optional later): B$S Blue #0E3A8A, Gold #CDA434, Orange #F28C28.
- Use accent sparingly: header rule or tiny dot only.

LAYOUT
- Headers/footers steady and quiet. Page numbers centered with em-dash wings.
- Boxes use single-line ASCII rules (+ - |). Keep inner line length < outer by 4 chars.
- Spacers: one empty line above/below content blocks.

CONTENT
- Four-line chapter pattern: Context, Principle, Modern, Test.
- Copy must be checkable, clear, and compact. No sermon tone.

USAGE
- Everything should survive as tattoo/logo/print at 1:1 and 1:10 scale.
- Never crowd sigils against borders. Minimum clear-space = height of the sigil's thickest stroke.

APPROVAL
- If any element feels like ornament, delete it. Function births form.
